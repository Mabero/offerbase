# Real-Time Training Material Updates

## Overview
The training materials system now includes real-time status updates that automatically refresh the UI when scraping status changes, eliminating the need for users to manually refresh the page.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Polling
- **Smart Polling**: Only polls when materials are in `pending` or `processing` state
- **Interval**: Checks for updates every 3 seconds
- **Auto-Stop**: Automatically stops polling when all materials are complete
- **Performance**: Minimal impact since it only runs when needed

### 2. Status Detection & Notifications
- **Change Detection**: Compares previous and current material statuses
- **Success Notifications**: Shows green toast when scraping succeeds
- **Error Notifications**: Shows red toast when scraping fails
- **Content Updates**: Automatically shows scraped content without refresh

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows "Checking for updates..." when polling is active
- **Real-time Badges**: Status badges update automatically (pending → processing → success/failed)
- **Instant Feedback**: Users see changes immediately without any action required
- **Content Preview**: Scraped content appears as soon as it's available

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Added polling logic and real-time state management
- `loadTrainingMaterials`: Enhanced to detect status changes and show notifications

### Key Features
```typescript
// Polling Management
const startPollingForUpdates = useCallback(...)
const stopPolling = useCallback(...)

// Status Change Detection
previousMaterials.forEach(material => {
  if (statusChanged) {
    showNotification(material)
  }
})

// Automatic UI Updates
useEffect(() => {
  if (hasProcessingMaterials) {
    startPolling()
  } else {
    stopPolling()
  }
}, [trainingMaterials])
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Conditional Polling**: Only runs when materials are being processed
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses refs to track previous state
- **Clean Cleanup**: Properly clears intervals on unmount
- **Error Handling**: Continues working even if individual polls fail

## User Flow
1. **Add URL** → Status shows "pending" immediately
2. **Background Processing** → Status updates to "processing" with loading spinner
3. **Completion** → Status changes to "success/failed" with notification
4. **Content Display** → Full content preview appears automatically
5. **Polling Stops** → No more API calls until next material is added

## Benefits
- ✅ No more manual refreshing required
- ✅ Immediate feedback on scraping progress
- ✅ Professional user experience
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Automatic notifications
- ✅ Minimal performance impact
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## Testing
1. Add a training material URL
2. Watch status change from pending → processing → success
3. Verify notification appears when complete
4. Confirm polling stops when all materials are done
5. Test retry functionality updates in real-time
